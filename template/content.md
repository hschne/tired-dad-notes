title: "Tired Dad Notes"
---

*Tired dad hasn't slept in a while. But be tired make tired dad have lots of deep think and observations about life with smol baby (deep think may also be onset of madness, tired dad not sure about that one). Now tired dad write down here for future himself. Also for you, to maybe have laugh (or bit despair, like tired dad).*

---

Sometimes tired dad feel like want something. Maybe want sleep or maybe want eat? Hah, smol baby no care what tired dad want! Is okay, tired dad learn be patient. Figure have baby make tired dad like buddhist monk. Life with smol baby much happier when let go of wants!

Make baby welcome to world is hard, hard work, very good job by tired mom! Many thing can go wrong - and do (tired dad talk to other tired dad and mom and learn lots of thing go wrong all the time!). Make tired dad glad and very happy that smol baby healthy!

Life with smol baby be very strange, because smol baby very weird in lots of ways. Maybe baby have weird hair, weird skin or weird toes?! Tired dad remember to not panic! Baby weird is okay and (mostly) normal.

Sometimes when have smol baby tired dad be sad, and tired mom be too. Make tired dad anxious, because tired parents supposed to be super happy with smol baby all the time, no?! Wrong! Is okay to be sad sometimes, silly.  

Have baby is super scary for tired dad. Baby so smol and look so frail! Other peoples say "No worry, new baby very tough!" but maybe tired dad not wholly believe.

Tired dad make very good plans and organize well. If forget something with smol baby then have angry baby really quick, must not happen! Still no matter because tired dad be tired and even good plan sometimes fail. Is okay tired dad, no get angry!

Baby sometimes act weird and tired dad make up stories for why baby do thing. Baby cry, so tired dad think maybe because see something scary? Maybe because not happy? Maybe because HATE tired dad?! Then tired dad stop and remember: No make up make believe stories! Baby be baby and do baby things because is baby, silly!

With smol baby, other peoples come talk to tired dad. Tell tired dad you do this with baby, otherwise bad tired dad (also tell this to tired mum). Tired dad very confuse by those people, but mostly try not to care. Remember, baby be baby from tired dad and tired mum, so tired parent know best what smol baby need!

Tired dad sometimes get confuse about baby and want help. If very tired and very confuse aks collective hivemind Internetz! This sound good but is bad. Very bad. Now tired dad be very very confuse and still no help!

Tired dad sometimes worry that smol baby no longer breathe. Silly, because every time tired dad check smol baby still breathe. Smol baby tough! Still, maybe tired dad check one more time, just for sure.

Before baby, many peoples tell (not yet tired) dad "You watch, Baby grow up quickly!". (Not yet tired) dad laugh, think people silly. Now tired dad know, self is silly! Baby grow up really really quickly, is like new baby every day sometimes!

Tired dad like as for help with big brain doctor. Is good help, doctor say tired dad do X! Good advice! But then, tired dad also ask big brain midwife for help. Midwife say, tired dad silly, never do X, do Y instead! Now tired dad not only tired but also super confuse. Figure, maybe both X and Y is okay, so do whatever works best for himself and baby!

With smol baby, really easy to be anxious or stressed. Lots of new thing to learn! Must remind self to stay calm, because no help if anxious or angry! But is very hard sometimes!

Smol baby not know how do lots of things. Not even know how breathe properly, so make lots of weird noise! Maybe like piglet or sick birdy? Very strange! But even stranger when weird noise stop! What wrong, maybe smol baby stop breathe?! No worry, yes baby still breathe silly tired dad!

Other peoples tell tired dad smol baby smell nice. This true sometimes, but lots of time baby make poo and then smell like dead racoon! Really not nice, silly peoples!  

Smol baby smile sometimes. This be very cute! But also mostly mean smol baby planning something, so very scary! Maybe giant dead racoon smelling poo again! What are you going to do now smol baby?!

Baby like to do strange things. Sometimes stare at random spots. Sometimes claw at your face (baby fingernails surprisingly sharp!). Sometimes randomly throw things on the ground. Tired dad figure baby be a lot like cat! Or maybe cat be like baby?

Tired dad sometimes worry that is gonna fuck up baby life. Then remember that everyone and everything is fucked up in some way. Is okay! Now tired dad just try to make sure smol baby is fucked up in a nice way.

Sometimes smol baby be real smol demon. Is cry all the time, is no sleep, is unbearable! Tired dad be ask "Why you so mean baby!?", maybe wonder if have baby was good idea even (is okay to think that sometimes). Then smol baby do a big laugh in dad face and suddenly everything okay again! Tired dad forgive you smol demon baby!

Carry baby around is hard work, make tired dad much back pain! Be careful tired dad!

When smol baby grow into not-so-smol baby it learn many new thing. This good and make tired dad very happy. But also make life with baby harder. Smol baby suddenly grab everything and throw down and make kaput, oh no!
