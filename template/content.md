Tired dad hasn't slept in a while. But be tired make tired dad have funny thoughts and observations about life with new baby. Tired dad write down here for himself and you to maybe have laugh (or bit despair).

Let go of wants

No normal birth

Everything is normal

Mommy sad, you sad, also normal

Everything is scary

Plan ahead and ditch those plans

Because it's baby

Everyone has opinion

Internet is evil

Yes, baby is still breathing 

Sometimes tired dad very stressed out. Is okay, taking care of baby is stressful! Tired dad remember to also take care of himself so can take care of smol baby. 

Before baby, many peoples tell (not yet tired) dad "You watch, Baby grow up quickly!". (Not yet tired) dad laugh, think people silly. Now tired dad know, self is silly! Baby grow up really really quickly, is like new baby every day sometimes!

Tired dad like as for help with big brain doctor. Is good help, doctor say tired dad do X! Good advice! But then, tired dad also ask big brain midwife for help. Midwife say, tired dad silly, never do X, do Y instead! Now tired dad not only tired but also super confuse. Figure, maybe both X and Y is okay, so do whatever works best for himself and baby!

With smol baby, really easy to be anxious or stressed. Lots of new thing to learn! Must remind self to stay calm, because no help if anxious or angry! But is very hard sometimes!

Smol baby not know how do lots of things. Not even know how breathe properly, so make lots of weird noise! Maybe like piglet or sick birdy? Very strange! But even stranger when weird noise stop! What wrong, maybe smol baby stop breathe?! No worry, yes baby still breathe silly tired dad!

Other peoples tell tired dad smol baby smell nice. This true sometimes, but lots of time baby make poo and then smell like dead racoon! Really not nice, silly peoples!  

Smol baby smile sometimes. This be very cute! But also mostly mean smol baby planning something, so very scary! Maybe giant dead racoon smelling poo again! What are you going to do now smol baby?!

Baby like to do strange things. Sometimes stare at random spots. Sometimes claw at your face (baby fingernails surprisingly sharp!). Sometimes randomly throw things on the ground. Tired dad figure baby be a lot like cat! Or maybe cat be like baby?

Tired dad sometimes worry that is gonna fuck up baby life. Then remember that everyone and everything is fucked up in some way. Is okay! Now tired dad just try to make sure smol baby is fucked up in a nice way.

Sometimes smol baby be real smol demon. Is cry all the time, is no sleep, is unbearable! Tired dad be ask "Why you so mean baby!?", maybe wonder if have baby was good idea even! Is okay to think that sometimes. Then smol baby do a big laugh in dad face and everything okay. I forgive you smol demon baby!

Carry baby make pain, careful
Baby learn new thing is best thing in world
