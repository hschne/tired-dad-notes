Let go of wants

No normal birth

Everything is normal

Mommy sad, you sad, also normal

Everything is scary

Plan ahead and ditch those plans

Because it's baby

Everyone has opinion

Internet is evil

Yes, baby is still breathing 

Try to get time off

Baby change quickly

Doctors vs midwifes

Stay calm

Baby make weird noises

Baby smelly, people say baby no smell but lies

When baby smile be afraid. Be very afraid.

Peace and quiet are fragile

Baby be like cat

Life is a trauma, you are gonna fuck up
