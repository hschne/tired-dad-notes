Tired dad hasn't slept in a while. But be tired make tired dad have funny thoughts and observations about life with new baby. Tired dad write down here for himself and you to maybe have laugh (or bit despair).

Let go of wants

No normal birth

Everything is normal

Mommy sad, you sad, also normal

Everything is scary

Plan ahead and ditch those plans

Because it's baby

Everyone has opinion

Internet is evil

Yes, baby is still breathing 

Sometimes tired dad very stressed out. Is okay, taking care of baby is stressful! Tired dad remember to also take care of himself so can take care of smol baby. 

Before baby, many peoples tell (not yet tired) dad "You watch, Baby grow up quickly!". (Not yet tired) dad laugh, think people silly. Now tired dad know, self is silly! Baby grow up really really quickly, is like new baby every day sometimes!

Tired dad like as for help with big brain doctor. Is good help, doctor say tired dad do X! Good advice! But then, tired dad also ask big brain midwife for help. Midwife say, tired dad silly, never do X, do Y instead! Now tired dad not only tired but also super confuse. Figure, maybe both X and Y is okay, so do whatever works best for himself and baby!

With smol baby, really easy to be anxious or stressed. Lots of new thing to learn! Must remind self to stay calm, because no help if anxious or angry! But is very hard sometimes!

Smol baby not know how do lots of things. Not even know how breathe properly, so make lots of weird noise! Maybe like piglet or sick birdy? Very strange! But even stranger when weird noise stop! What wrong, maybe smol baby stop breathe?! No worry, yes baby still breathe silly tired dad!

Other peoples tell tired dad smol baby smell nice. This true sometimes, but lots of time baby make poo and then smell like dead racoon! Really not nice, silly peoples!  

Smol baby smile sometimes and be very cute. But when happens, tired
When baby smile be afraid. Be very afraid.

Peace and quiet are fragile

Baby be like cat

Life is a trauma, you are gonna fuck up
